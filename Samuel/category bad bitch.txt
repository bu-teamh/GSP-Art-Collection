COMBAT

- Areas locked during combat for enemies/player
- Control TBC

BASIC ATTACK
- Achilles spear style fwd attack -> direction of cursor
- Lantern can't be direclty controlled
- When aiming, and player moves, lantern *slowly moves in the direction of player (maintain aim)

ENEMIES
- 2 kinds - cultist bitch / spider (+ mommy)
- every enemy type has flavours - (we need one for every buff but for now just 2)
- which is : ranged+damage(likely rock); melee+damage(likely fire)
- new enemy flavour everytime boss defeated/+ new buff ( GDDD but we will intro. rock buff in cave)
GDD but not gonna make (ideas welcome):
ranged+squid ink mariokart hallucination
melee+slowdown

parry - lantern does forcefield - radius centred on lantern - 
big enough to cover child if near, if lantern far away, dont work
dodge - child, has to be executed well to charge meter
"
"CHARGERS"
